Hi this is a start of an OS for the Riverdi 7"{} stm32\+H757 displays.  \+It is based on the Visual\+GDB platform. The goal is to make 2 projects one for the CM7 and one for the CM4 core. First the goal is to make the CM7 handle the setup and have the Diplay working.  \+I want to make some sort of platform (\+Visual studio plugin) to setup the clocksystem (cube\+MX clon) and to design the display layout (\+LVGL clon). If you have any knowlege of making Visual studio plugin please let me know \+:-\/)  $<$img src="{}\href{https://github.com/SorenGullach/Riverdi_OS_test/blob/master/html/classgl_link.png}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Soren\+Gullach/\+Riverdi\+\_\+\+OS\+\_\+test/blob/master/html/classgl\+\_\+link.\+png}}"{} alt="{}The current GL libary"{}/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}
